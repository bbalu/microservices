# microservices

## characteristics (based on [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#CharacteristicsOfAMicroserviceArchitecture) )

* **Componentization of Services**

*component is a unit of software that is independently replaceable and upgradeable.*

* **Organized around business capabilities**

* **Products not projects**

* **Smart Endpoints and dump pipes**

* **Decentralized Governance**

* **Decentralized Data Management**

### API Gateway

[Kong](http://getkong.org/)

Open source management layer for APIs built on top of NGINX

[Tyk](https://github.com/lonelycode/tyk)

Tyk is a lightweight, open source API Gateway and enables you to control who accesses your API, when they access it and how they access it. Tyk will also record detailed analytics on how your users are interacting with your API and when things go wrong.
Written in [Go](http://golang.org/) language.

[OpenLoop](http://loopback.io/)

LoopBack is an open source Node.js framework built on top of Express optimized for building APIs for mobile, web, and other devices. Connect to multiple data sources, write business logic in Node.js, glue on top of your existing services and data, connect using JS, iOS & Android SDKs.

### Service

Follow 12 rules when implementing a service using [12 factor methodology](http://12factor.net/)

**CircuitBreaker pattern**

[Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html)

CircuitBreaker pattern from Michael Nygardâ€™s book ["Release It! Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software"](http://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it)

**Bulkhead pattern**

**Timeout pattern**

### Shared Services

* Service Discovery

* routing

* scheduling 

* logging

* health management

* metrics

* access control

* security
