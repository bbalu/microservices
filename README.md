## API Gateway



### [Kong](http://getkong.org/)

Open source management layer for APIs built on top of NGINX


### [Tyk](https://github.com/lonelycode/tyk)

Tyk is a lightweight, open source API Gateway and enables you to control who accesses your API, when they access it and how they access it. Tyk will also record detailed analytics on how your users are interacting with your API and when things go wrong.
Written in [Go](http://golang.org/) language.
